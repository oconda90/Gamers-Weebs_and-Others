# Gamers-Weebs_and-Others
Starter project for new website

I made this project in hopes to bring people closer to eachother. I've love to play video games and I have for 
a long time now. I am player that likes action games, the feeling of competitiveness and thrill of constant action 
is the most enjoyable. There are also times where I like to play a more casual and calm game. Those moments seem to end soon and come up
rarely. I always seem to find myself playing FPS(First Person Shooters). I have a few frineds which I play games with but I'm the only one 
in the group that enjoys Fps. As time goes on I'm always gaming on my own which doesnt bother to me much beides the main issue 
which is fps games get boring playing by yourself. There has been times when I go looking for players to play with but usually staying contact 
after playing a session is difficult.

I am making a solution to my own problwm in hope it can help others as well. The website Gamers,Weebs and Others will provide a personalized profile where one can add their gamertag in hopes to find others to play with. However the main feature will be the ability to choose a specified
game or show and be redirected to that small community.The main channel will have sub channels to talk about Patch Notes, experince in playing the game or simply to find people in search of people to play with. Small features will consist of adding people to a friends list and have a direct messaging system.
